Determine GPS location with minimal receiver time.

## Note this project is currently in development and is not yet functional.

The intent of this project is to provide open source code to calculate a unique position and time from a short wideband recording of the GPS band using software defined radio techniques.

To set up test files:

* Download [brdc0940.13n.Z](https://cddis.nasa.gov/archive/gnss/data/daily/2013/094/13n/brdc0940.13n.Z). You may need to register for an account on CDDIS to do this.
* Download [2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.tar.gz](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnss-sdr/files/data/2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.tar.gz)
* Decompress the contents of 2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.tar.gz into the project directory.
